Microsoft Teams Integration Guide

This document outlines the integration process for DocuSense with Microsoft Teams, enabling users to search documents directly from their Teams interface.

Integration Methods:
1. Teams App - Custom Teams application with search interface
2. Bot Framework - Conversational search through Teams bot
3. Message Extensions - Search documents while composing messages
4. Adaptive Cards - Rich document preview cards

Authentication:
The integration uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for seamless single sign-on. Users authenticate once and gain access to all authorized documents across the organization.

User Experience:
Users can search documents using natural language queries directly within Teams. Results are displayed as interactive cards showing document titles, snippets, and relevance scores. Clicking a result opens the full document in the appropriate application.

The Teams app can be deployed organization-wide through the Teams Admin Center. IT administrators can control access permissions and configure search scopes based on user roles and departments.

Benefits:
- Reduced context switching between applications
- Improved productivity through faster document discovery
- Enhanced collaboration with shared search results
- Consistent user experience across Teams and document repositories

Technical Requirements:
- Microsoft 365 subscription with Teams

Support and Maintenance:
Regular updates ensure compatibility with new Teams features. The system includes monitoring and analytics to track usage patterns and optimize search performance.
