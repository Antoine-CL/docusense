# SharePoint Integration Test Document

This document simulates a file that would be found in SharePoint/OneDrive to test the ingestion pipeline.

## Document Discovery Test

The OneDrive ingestion script should be able to:
1. Connect to Microsoft Graph API
2. Discover SharePoint document libraries
3. List files in those libraries
4. Download and process text files like this one

## Content for Semantic Search

DocuSense provides intelligent document search across Microsoft Teams environments. Key features include:

- **Multi-tenant architecture**: Each organization gets isolated search results
- **Semantic search**: Uses Azure OpenAI embeddings for meaning-based search
- **Teams integration**: Seamlessly embedded as a Teams tab
- **Real-time sync**: Automatically indexes new documents from SharePoint
